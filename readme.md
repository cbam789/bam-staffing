bam-staffing

bam-staffing is a lightweight staffing optimization tool that helps you calculate real available work hours after accounting for all the hidden time drains — like prep time, breaks, and other constraints.

Perfect for small businesses, operations managers, or anyone scheduling staff based on actual capacity instead of “on paper” hours.

✨ Features

Capacity vs. Demand modeling

Real-world availability calculation (buffers, breaks, etc.)

Staffing recommendations based on customer throughput

Simple input → actionable output

Portable executable version available for quick use

📊 Example Use Case

Imagine a staff member is scheduled for 8 hours, but:

1 hour is lost to setup/closing

2 × 15-minute breaks are required

Each customer takes 30 minutes to serve

Result: Actual bookable time is ~6 hours, meaning they can serve ~12 customers — not 16.
